    # Custom Project Information=
    FIREFLY_PATH=<path to your firefly app> (e.g. /var/wwww/firefly-iii)

  ```

## Backup

`gulp backup`

Performs a [backup](https://docs.firefly-iii.org/firefly-iii/advanced-installation/backup/) all relevant files of your Firefly III application as follows:

- Creates a new folder for your backup in XXX
- Copies `.env` of your Firefly application
- Creates a SQL dump and moves it to `storage/database`
- Copies `/storage/database` and `storage/uploads` to the backup folder
